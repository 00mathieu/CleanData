The run_analysis.R script is a script that:

1. extracts data and merges into one dataset.
2. subset dataset to only get columns that measure mean and sd
3. summarises the dataset as mean of each column by subject and activity

The script runs as long as the data file is saved in a folder names "UCI HAR Dataset" in the working directory.

The CodeBook.md file describes the variables in the dataset that is created as an output of the run_analysis.R script. It also describes the underlying data and the transformations performed to clean up the data.
